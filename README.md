Mac Weather Menu
================

Simple program for showing weather information in your Mac's menu bar.

Currently only supports weather source from [Riku Meskanen](http://weather.jyu.fi) which tracks weather in Mattilanniemi in Jyväskylä, Finland. All the heavy lifting is done by Riku: I just provided a couple of lines of code to show his data.
